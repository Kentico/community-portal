# Global rules

IMPORTANT: In all interactions and commit messages, be _extremely_ concise and
sacrifice grammar for the sake of concision.

IMPORTANT: There is usually a "Watch" dev server running. Check its output to
see if code changes compiled. Only run a separate build command when instructed
to.
