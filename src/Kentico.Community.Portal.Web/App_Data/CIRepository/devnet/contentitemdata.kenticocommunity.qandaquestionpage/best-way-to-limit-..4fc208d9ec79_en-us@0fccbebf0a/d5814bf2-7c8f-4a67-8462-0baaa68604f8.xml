<![CDATA[
Since the latest releases there was an update to limit the page types which a user could create in a channel or even in a specific path.\
We have currently the issue, that we have content elements in ContentHub, which holds texts for a static widget which can be selected on a page. These elements are created by the admin, and it should not be possible for a user to create them, because there is only one for each static widget. Is there a way to limit the available content types in ContentHub or to limit them in a specific workspace or is there a plan to include this, like with the pages?

What we would need is to not show these content types if a user wants to create a new element and only the admin is able to create them.
