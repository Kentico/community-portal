Hi,

I’d be really grateful if you could share a couple of insights I could use as input for my upcoming blog post. The topic will be productivity tips related to AI in migration projects (by migration project, I mean replatforming a website from an older Kentico version or from another CMS/DXP to Xperience by Kentico).

1. What is the main code editor/IDE you use on Xperience by Kentico projects, and what AI-related features (if any) help you in your development work?
2. What is your typical workflow for handling migration projects when it comes to migrating individual features and code files? Personally, I initially struggled with this, as it felt cumbersome to keep two code editors open side by side, switching between them while moving files and code snippets. I’ve since found a more productive approach, but I’d love to hear your tips and methods, as this was something that really slowed me down for a while.
3. Are there any specific areas where you’ve been struggling with productivity, and have you found an AI-related solution for them, or are they still unresolved?
