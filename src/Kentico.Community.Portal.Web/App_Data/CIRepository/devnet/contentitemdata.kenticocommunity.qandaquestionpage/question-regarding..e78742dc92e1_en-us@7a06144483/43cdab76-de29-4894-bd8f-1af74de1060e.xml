Hi all,

I've just been reading about automatic image file type conversion, as described in your docs linked. I recently saw a social media post about how you can upload imagery into the XbyK content hub and define rules that automatically convert that image to WebP, for example.&#x20;

Is this a conversion of the original physical file, or is this a conversion when the image is served via the API? Your docs sound like it changes the original uploaded file in the content hub.

Does this mean...

* If the CMS editor then downloads that file again, will it give them a WebP instead of the JPG or PNG (etc) they might have been expecting?
* And does this work well with email channels, or do you advise against using this if you are using an email channel? I'm may be totally wrong but I think many email clients still have an issue serving WebP?

We're looking to use XbyK SaaS in our next build, and I need to figure out the best way of serving imagery, because historically we've always used our own self-hosted image processing module.
