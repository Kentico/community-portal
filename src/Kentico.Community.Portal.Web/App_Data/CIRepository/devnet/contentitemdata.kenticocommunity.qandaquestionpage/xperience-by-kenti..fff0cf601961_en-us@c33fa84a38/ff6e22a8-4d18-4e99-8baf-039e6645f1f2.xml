I'm battling with index results sorting using the Xperience By Kentico Lucene integration, I thought it was working during earlier testing but I have updated the version since then.

I've been looking through the XbyK Lucene repository and docs and I've picked up in the examples that they've now included a SortableTitle on top of the normal title (one is tokenized and the other not) and I've tried to include the same, however I still seem to have having the same issues.

It looks like its attempting to do a z-a sort in my case starting with a 'Z' item but 2nd item is already out of place and should be a the end of the listing

Having picked up on the SortableTitle and it being a non-tokenized string I guess the first question I'm asking is have I missed anything relating to that I might have missed?
