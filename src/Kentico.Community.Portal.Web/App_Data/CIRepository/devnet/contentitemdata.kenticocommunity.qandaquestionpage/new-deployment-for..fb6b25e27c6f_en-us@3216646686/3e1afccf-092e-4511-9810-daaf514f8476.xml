<![CDATA[
I have a client who has already built a project with a channel-type website on the Kentico administration page (CMS). Let's call this **Project A**. Currently, I have created a new project, **Project B**, with a channel type of **Headless**. I attempted to create a deployment package to publish it to the QA environment. After publishing, I checked the CMS and noticed that the headless channel was created successfully. However, the existing channel (Project A) seems to have been replaced by the new one. As a result, I can no longer preview the existing pages on the QA CMS.

When I created Project B, I followed the instructions from scratch using the [first installation guide](https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/installation). I used the kentico-xperience-mvc template. My question is: How can I publish Project B to the portal without replacing the existing project (Project A)?

I followed the instructions in the [Deploy to SaaS guide](https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment) to create the deployment package. I'm using the same salt hash from the portal when i created Project B
