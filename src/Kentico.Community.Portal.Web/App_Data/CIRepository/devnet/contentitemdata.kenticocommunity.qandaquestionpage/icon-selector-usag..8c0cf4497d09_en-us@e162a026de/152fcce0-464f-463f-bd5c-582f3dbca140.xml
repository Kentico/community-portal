<![CDATA[
I'm currently working on a feature where I'm attempting to leverage the built-in **Icon selector** form control to add icons to a Content Type within my site.

I see that when an icon is selected on a Content Item, the name is what gets saved in the database (e.g. **xp-accordion**). I was hoping the existing approach of using icons in the UI would be the same as in Kentico Xperience 13 (<https://docs.kentico.com/13/custom-development/extending-the-administration-interface/working-with-font-icons>), where I can just throw this into the class of an icon element, but this doesn't appear to be the case.

I haven't seen any documentation on this topic for Xperience by Kentico, so I was curious of the following:

1. Is this possible, and I'm just missing the documentation on it?
2. If #1 isn't true, are there any plans to add this into the product any time soon?

I'll roll my own custom solution if that's the best path forward, but don't want to invest the time in the event it's already possible and I'm missing it, or if it's going to be functionality that's added in the not too distant future.

***

**Environment**

* Xperience by Kentico version: 29.6.2
* .NET version: 8
