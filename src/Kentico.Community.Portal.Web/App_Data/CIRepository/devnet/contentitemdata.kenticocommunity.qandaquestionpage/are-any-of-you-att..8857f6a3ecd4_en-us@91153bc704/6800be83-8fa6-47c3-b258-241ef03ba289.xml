<![CDATA[
In the before times, back in 2015-2019, while working for a digital agency, I was attending many local user groups and traveling to software development (and Kentico) conferences.

During the days of COVID that travel decreased significantly - some conferences held virtual events, others stopped functioning. Since working for Kentico I've attended quite a few conferences and most feel the same as they did in the 2010s. However, it seemed local user groups were hit even harder by COVID's disruptions and they have not bounced back at all. Maybe it's a generational thing? Maybe it's a trend away from in-person towards digital?

Have you attended any digital marketing or software development conferences this year? What about local user groups? If you participated in these events in the past, do they seem different now?

I ask because Kentico recently announced [we're sponsoring Beer City Code 2025](https://www.kentico.com/discover/events/beer-city-code-2025) in [Grand Rapids, Michigan](https://www.beercitycode.com/) this year. Hopefully some people from the Kentico community show up and say hi to each other!

Are there other events you imagine multiple members of the Kentico community might attend that you recommend others check out?

Two events near me that are well loved are [CodeMash](https://codemash.org/) and [StirTrek](https://stirtrek.com/), and surprisingly ... I still haven't been to either!
