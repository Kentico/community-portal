I am attempting to associate pages that I migrated over from an older instance with new page templates that were created for items of that type, but I am getting this error:



```CSharp
InvalidOperationException: The web page (WebPageItemID: '7096', Content type: Convenience.Page) is requested to be rendered via a page template (called 'TemplateResult' in a MVC controller). However, the web page does not have a page template assigned. Re-create the page and select a page template during the web page creation process.
```

***

Is there a way to assign a template to these pages without having to re-create them or else what is the point of migrating them over? There are literally thousands of pages and so re-creating them all isn't really an option. I've been trying to see if there is somewhere in the database that it assigns a template value but have not been able to successfully locate it.&#x20;



Any help would be most appreciated.
