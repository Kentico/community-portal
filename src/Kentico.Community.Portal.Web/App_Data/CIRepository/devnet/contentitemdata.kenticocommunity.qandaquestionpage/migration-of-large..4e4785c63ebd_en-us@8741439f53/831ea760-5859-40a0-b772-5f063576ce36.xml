<![CDATA[
I have a XbK v30.8.0 solution with 4 sites that was a migration from Kentico 12 to XbK that has an /assets (and therefore \$StorageAssets) folder with a size of nearly 14 GB and a database that is \~40GB.&#x20;

How am I supposed to get this into SaaS? I can use Content Sync for some, CD for others but none of those tools seem to be able to handle this large of a data set.

Is there some way for me to upload the \$StorageAssets folder to the Azure blob by myself or doe sit only happen during CD? The 2GB package limitation will not work.

I know I can reach out to the SaaS team about placing my database, is that going to be the best bet to get everything there as quickly as possible? I have my CD's repository.config setup to only include bare minimum (sites, page types, countries / states, users...) currently but I can add some additional items there, but likely not all of it.

* Xperience by Kentico version: \[30.8.0]
