His guest on this episode, [James Montemagno](https://montemagno.com), works at Microsoft supporting developer communities and has been writing C# since the mid-2000s. Both know their tech and software development but they sit on different sides of the AI fence.\n\nScott is cautious about vibe-coding, especially taking it all the way to production. James, however, sees it differently, based on his experience shipping a sentiment analysis app built largely with AI assistance:\n\n* **Total Code**: \\~17,000 lines\n\n* **Code He Wrote**: Only 20 lines (complex JSON parsing that AI couldn't handle)\n\n* **Timeline**: Zero to deployed in 3 days\n\n* **Tech Stack**: Blazor frontend, Azure Functions backend, Azure AI services\n\nHere's how James explained vibe-coding:\n\n> If you apply the same concept of how we've been developing software to working closely with our AI counterparts to help us get that code completed, then to me that is the vibe. Now the traditional vibe coding definition is forget the code, the code doesn't exist. Be one with the ai. That's not my vibe, Scott. And *I think everybody has their own interpretation of vibe coding*.\n>\n> \\[...]\n>\n> So as I've been evolving, I've been vibing as the AI does something that I like, I update my instructions to tell it to go do that. \\[..] If it does something I don't like doing, I tell it don't to do that \\[..] So as I'm working with it, I am, for all intents and purposes, crafting and making it better over time.\n>\n> \\[...]\n>\n> if I already have a project or I've been working in a project and vibing in a project and I've been working on these best practices, it's gonna follow my best practices.\n\nJames emphasizes building a personal AI toolkit:\n\n* **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers** for extended capabilities\n\n* **Multiple AI models** for different tasks (Claude for exploration, GPT-4 for focused work)\n\n* **Integration tools** like Perplexity for research, GitHub for issue creation\n\n* **Custom workflows** tailored to individual development preferences\n\nAnd, there are specific areas where he is much more trusting with \"vibing\" out his code, like CSS and design and initial code generation.\n\nThis honestly feels like the approach I've been taking recently - craft a prompt, supply context, see what the AI generated. If it doesn't match what I'm looking for, I adjust the context (ex: [with rules files](/blog/control-your-ai-context-for-easier-kentico-development-with-github-copilot-custom-instructions)). I also rely on the existing code that's been generated by AI and approved by me or I've crafted myself. This context also helps keep things on track.\n\nYes, there are a variety of challenges that come with allowing the agent to do more of the work, like generating code you don't truly understand or code that will become a maintenance challenge, but these existed _before_ AI.\n\n* If understanding the generated code is important for security and predictable behavior, developers can use AI to learn how the code works and become more knowledgeable in the process!\n\n* If maintainable software is a project priority, developers have tools (instructions and context) to [focus the agent](/blog/enhance-kentico-development-with-a-custom-ai-chat-mode-in-github-copilot) and produce maintainable code.\n\nJames shifts perspective by highlighting other ways agentic software development *benefits developers*:\n\n* **Removing toil** from development work (like [updating Dancing Goat to the new content retriever API](/blog/evolving-dancing-goat-with-agentic-ai-software-development))\n\n* **Enabling projects** that wouldn't otherwise get completed\n\n* **Learning opportunities** in unfamiliar technologies\n\n* **Focus on interesting problems** rather than boilerplate&#x20;\n\nWhether or not you think vibe-coding is real, or the future, or whatever... explore, [try stuff out](/blog/ai-assisted-improvements-to-the-kentico-community-portal), and find your vibe with AI tools.\n","markdownStyle":"Standard","markdownStyleParsed":0,"markdownCodeLanguage":"","id":"1260caf9-abb4-42f7-b1fa-c9dcf76e2f76"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"markdown":"ac44683e-f746-4237-a7fa-a0af89e6f733","markdownStyle":"fecd064c-77a6-48d6-8eb2-d01468f90525","markdownStyleParsed":"8ec404e9-8997-4d9c-9fda-464beb519684","markdownCodeLanguage":"98aa1dde-7d9c-4130-bf81-8a695216860c","id":"484f0b8b-baf0-4ddc-91f0-999bb4db0db9"}}]},{"identifier":"f68d8d49-1f76-47e0-9116-3399fff252ec","type":"CommunityPortal.MarkdownWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"5c99277c-2e6d-4a83-8f45-ede6c2d4ad0d","properties":{"markdown":"Listen to the full episode - [Hanselminutes: Is Vibe Coding Real? with James Montemagno](https://www.hanselminutes.com/996/is-vibe-coding-real-with-james-montemagno).\n","markdownStyle":"Note","markdownStyleParsed":1,"markdownCodeLanguage":"","id":"a8e7a98f-9ef3-446d-8655-303c7a3dfc56"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"markdown":"b3520069-6aa2-41b5-b141-fb2fe6262f35","markdownStyle":"ed0e6414-0371-4c26-aaac-7bd3ba92cea1","markdownStyleParsed":"7e22220c-792f-4375-8a8f-c863dfd88387","markdownCodeLanguage":"044d8cf8-2532-4ceb-8444-37d1866eccb5","id":"eb3b8046-a92f-43d9-bd47-fc3223f1d31f"}}]}]}],"fieldIdentifiers":{"layout":"3382c38e-a76c-4819-99b5-a07dfd128da3","layoutParsed":"38f70774-7d03-4f8d-9e3e-b8018e85400a","paddingTop":"469cb398-1455-4f26-8131-7c04253bcdb4","paddingTopParsed":"dc763be7-bbbc-408d-b8c0-efc83f6984a4","paddingBottom":"5709c2ee-973b-4cbd-be72-45bba660597d","paddingBottomParsed":"f4833998-74fb-43f4-b992-25ee587ec97c","backgroundColor":"71f7dd26-78c4-49c0-a07f-d48d487d71d2","backgroundColorParsed":"547406b2-12dc-45a0-95ec-2f7e7b0b2ef1"}},{"identifier":"708f683f-6a6f-4c0e-b814-3b49c6b9387c","type":"CommunityPortal.SingleColumnSection","properties":{"layout":"Standard","layoutParsed":0,"paddingTop":"Large","paddingTopParsed":0,"paddingBottom":"Large","paddingBottomParsed":0,"backgroundColor":"White","backgroundColorParsed":1},"zones":[{"identifier":"9aeac25a-bb6d-4929-a4f6-3c0b9e199d8d","widgets":[{"identifier":"a4c92586-d7c0-4c7f-86bd-5dc6d5279671","type":"CommunityPortal.HeadingWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"7754bc9c-2082-46ee-bbef-2323b4ed4b21","properties":{"headingText":"The Changelog: Agent, take the wheel","headingLevel":"H2","headingLevelsParsed":1,"headingAlignment":"Left","headingAlignmentsParsed":0,"showHeadingAnchor":true,"id":"835b6527-2a50-4676-aad0-eb55614e0be3"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"headingText":"73c47656-0913-4f67-85c1-270c52be09f5","headingLevel":"8bcb5dbf-3dec-442b-875a-b47334e06bd8","headingLevelsParsed":"69156bc4-4c22-4738-9098-13a63ffdd42f","headingAlignment":"658b807e-5331-4254-afd3-7b171c20ac9e","headingAlignmentsParsed":"fc51470f-b853-4104-a88e-3c914e4048e8","showHeadingAnchor":"9c2f29ec-7a38-4ae6-9131-4c85e292766a","id":"97d39c0b-85f8-4030-837b-65f0c5e4a999"}}]},{"identifier":"e27d2846-8e20-4aae-b4c3-55e7bb2b8993","type":"CommunityPortal.MarkdownWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"9449b4f0-2cc1-4f61-b0cd-150a94901c09","properties":{"markdown":"In this episode, the Changelog crew talks with Thorsten Ball, creator of [Amp](https://ampcode.com) - an agentic coding tool - and an enthusiastic advocate for the power it brings to developers.\n\nThorsten wrote a blog post titled [How to Build an Agent or: The Emperor Has No Clothes](https://ampcode.com/how-to-build-an-agent) which walks developers step by step through the non-magic process of creating an AI agent. He feels that developers should look what's going on behind the scenes with the AI tools being marketed to them. If they see there's no magic, they will gain an appreciation and a deeper understanding that will help them adopt and be more productive with agents.\n\n> a lot of the copy from other AI software is this “AI, magic… It knows everything about you… It’s going to replace you, and it’s going to replace your job, and whatever you’re doing.” And for me, the fascinating bit is that these are incredibly powerful tools. Let’s figure out how to yield them, let’s figure out how to make real use of them, and just… Come along, let’s use this. Everything is changing. These are incredible tools, that will change software in the next years tremendously. \n\nWhen a programming language feature doesn't behave how you expect, or a component library doesn't produce the right user experience, developers typically investigate a layer deeper, read the source code, and explore how the technology works. This helps them use their tools well and come up with creative solutions.\n\nAI technology has been moving at such a rapid pace that most developers **haven't had time** to explore how things work. This leaves us in a position where:\n\n* AI is everywhere.\n\n* Adoption is expected.\n\n* Developers see it fail when pushed beyond demo scenarios.\n\nIn other software development technology spaces we would pause, read the source, and understand **why**.\n\nThorsten suggests that we *can* and *should* do this with AI as well. He mentions the example of agent's tool calling - it's actually not that complex!\n\n> \\[...] with tool calling, you basically start a conversation with the LLM and you say “In the following conversation, when you feel the need to, say, read a file, or list files, or…” What else? “Run a terminal command, respond in this specific way. Respond with a message that starts with “tool call, name, read file”, like in a specific syntax. And they’re trained on this. So when the model “thinks”, in quotes, air quotes, for everybody listening, if it thinks it needs to call a tool, it will respond in a specific way. And that’s it. That’s the whole magic trick.\n>\n> \\[...]\n>\n> And this has collapsed into the model, because now you can give them tools, and they do this on their own. And it’s truly like just a for loop.\n>\n> And the funny thing is if, I don’t know, if you ask a hundred engineers, half of them would say “It’s just a for loop.” And the others would say, with a smile on their face, “It’s just a for loop. Like, this is crazy.”\n\nSo, *if* developers did take the time to explore the software behind AI agents, they would realize they're surprisingly simple at their core:\n\n* **Tool Calling**: Give the AI access to simple tools (read file, list directory, run terminal commands)\n\n* **Loop Until Success**: The agent tries approaches, gets feedback, and iterates until the problem is solved\n\n* **Minimal Code**: A functional agent can be built in \\~300 lines of code\n\nAdditionally, something you tried a year ago might have failed or required too much effort, and that experience sticks with you and leads to valid skepticism. But, because AI technology is moving so quickly that experience and skepticism might already be outdated!\n\nHere are some reasons developers remain skeptical about AI, as mentioned in the podcast:\n\n* **Outdated Experience**: People tried early AI tools and dismissed them\n\n* **Unrealistic Expectations**: Expecting AGI-level performance immediately\n\n* **Learning Curve Denial**: Treating AI as magic rather than a tool requiring skill\n\nFor me, this episode was a great reminder that two things can both be true.\n\n* AI agents are **powerful**\n\n* AI agents are **simple**\n\n","markdownStyle":"Standard","markdownStyleParsed":0,"markdownCodeLanguage":"","id":"8e483203-671d-4f2e-a159-ede94c91fe67"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"markdown":"8375789d-6bf3-4ef2-b3d0-1b7fc953ae9b","markdownStyle":"42d4da50-9efd-40c5-98a2-d7a1da4f6baf","markdownStyleParsed":"a448d9ee-ade8-48ab-b895-10f47afa6da9","markdownCodeLanguage":"79f6efc5-b022-450f-93f1-33a33699563e","id":"4d28db07-da25-43c4-9019-ae8c5b8522c2"}}]},{"identifier":"2ea6bc0a-aa2f-492f-a8ad-c7f370e875d3","type":"CommunityPortal.MarkdownWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"8207478c-0fd6-4fcf-9df3-7f8c45406ba1","properties":{"markdown":"Listen to the full episode - [The Changelog: Agent, take the wheel](https://changelog.com/podcast/648).\n","markdownStyle":"Note","markdownStyleParsed":1,"markdownCodeLanguage":"","id":"a8e7a98f-9ef3-446d-8655-303c7a3dfc56"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"markdown":"3cae230c-8d67-48d6-958e-cf940a1f81fc","markdownStyle":"93fed385-d408-4764-891a-fe389501808b","markdownStyleParsed":"b74258c6-db5e-4beb-9982-610927e7faf9","markdownCodeLanguage":"c22e3c57-8c2d-40aa-8afe-640f72223adc","id":"c18346d8-005c-4bf2-87f7-5d5697cadcee"}}]}]}],"fieldIdentifiers":{"layout":"1675bd16-5f32-4f0c-a0a1-ebb4e431f3c0","layoutParsed":"bf61722f-1b2c-49e5-868e-2fbfbe3db83a","paddingTop":"e3c1fa0e-275f-4112-81e3-6eb8ffc3dda5","paddingTopParsed":"a8680214-4bcb-40ef-b56b-4caa0883375a","paddingBottom":"3c15e09a-3b59-4285-9863-62925d94bf16","paddingBottomParsed":"b0488fdb-50d2-4480-afab-4e1cfcc170c3","backgroundColor":"34940369-253b-422f-90e8-717ccf4bc5bf","backgroundColorParsed":"777d22b7-74f8-4560-9802-a32623099e8c"}},{"identifier":"a733d5fc-c5f9-403c-9e83-127325420cf2","type":"CommunityPortal.SingleColumnSection","properties":{"layout":"Standard","layoutParsed":0,"paddingTop":"Large","paddingTopParsed":0,"paddingBottom":"Large","paddingBottomParsed":0,"backgroundColor":"White","backgroundColorParsed":1},"zones":[{"identifier":"d34e7a87-4155-4438-be29-5d4f20d5f246","widgets":[{"identifier":"f2422143-2df4-41ca-8e13-ff3ed52b744c","type":"CommunityPortal.HeadingWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"3069d7e1-1cdb-4a12-805b-df1e46567c6e","properties":{"headingText":"CoRecursive: When AI Codes, What’s Left for me?","headingLevel":"H2","headingLevelsParsed":1,"headingAlignment":"Left","headingAlignmentsParsed":0,"showHeadingAnchor":true,"id":"835b6527-2a50-4676-aad0-eb55614e0be3"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"headingText":"1e00d567-6a8e-42de-ac6a-686c22e4ba8b","headingLevel":"26cf0f2c-6dbc-4c40-9625-05d8929c4ed8","headingLevelsParsed":"71d2fbe3-98bf-4833-aa95-387681edc6e7","headingAlignment":"c9491e45-2659-427b-ac3c-496b5fa537a3","headingAlignmentsParsed":"47f6706d-d9a4-4889-a110-cf90e805770a","showHeadingAnchor":"094a908c-aa55-4321-a9f5-7178a1d07948","id":"339dfee7-2e99-4968-9257-1cfdf3ec7eb7"}}]},{"identifier":"1bba446e-8a9d-4dca-a88b-65c5f4821375","type":"CommunityPortal.MarkdownWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"a36c8747-d302-4121-91da-39c02668e3d3","properties":{"markdown":"CoRecursive is one of my favorite software development podcasts because Adam, the host, does a great job featuring guests that have their own unique stories.

I’ve seen enough tool changes to recognize when something’s worth exploring. I feel like if you love building things, if you like to create, nobody can take that away from you. Not a boss, not a new tool, not even yourself. The urge to build these side projects and experiments that I love to create, it’s just part of who I am, right? And AI can’t take that away from me, but maybe it can help me.\n\nThis quote is relevant to my story at least, because I learned to enjoy building with technology before I had all the tools I've become productive with, so I believe I can continue to enjoy building with a new set of tools - including AI and agents.\n\nBut that doesn't mean I'm comfortable with this change, probably because there's some fear involved.\n\n> I think that a lot of resistance to AI coding tools comes from the same place: fear of losing something that has defined you for so long.\n\nSo, two forces are at play here - fear of losing control or being replaced, and inflated expectations fueled by AI hype. Billions are being invested in technology and products products... and marketing. You can't escape it!\n\nThankfully, Adam also gives some advice on how to overcome this fear.\n\n> Treat it as a chance to learn something new. Start small, right?\n>\n> \\[...]\n>\n> But these tools aren’t magic. Like they’re not gonna nail every problem on the first try. I think of it more of like working with a teammate. You need to go back and forth. You need to refine what you’re working on. You need to collaborate to get good results. \\[...] That’s not a flaw, that’s just how building things actually works. Right? The same would happen if I were designing something with a colleague.\n\nHere's the summary of the approach I've been taking:\n\n* **No biases** - ignore the hype and leave your skepticism behind.\n\n* **Adjust your expectations** - start with something small and give this new technology an honest try... **it's not magic**!\n\n* **Remember you enjoy building** - code is just a tool we use to build; there are other tools and we have many other skills we use daily.\n\n* **Don't forget you're still allowed to code** - you can balance which skills you keep sharp and how much time you spend on them.\n\n* *You're going to grow and adapt and be ok* 😉\n\n","markdownStyle":"Standard","markdownStyleParsed":0,"markdownCodeLanguage":"","id":"20d6ac88-6f07-4f3c-a6ec-cc2e4073fc8e"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"markdown":"f7819ccb-9b08-4c7c-b92c-4f7d30f7b50d","markdownStyle":"a0c0aa48-360e-47bb-be69-fcc10a8e6b8e","markdownStyleParsed":"6a27a97c-83eb-4aa1-907a-d7ec024c6e89","markdownCodeLanguage":"b0265705-b09b-4b5a-9d87-667811855a18","id":"d54dbcb7-0052-4871-aebe-9b6dcef8a683"}}]},{"identifier":"98bba400-7f0a-45cc-82f4-bf882bbc1d65","type":"CommunityPortal.MarkdownWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"8d456561-cc7b-435b-9530-cd02b9218489","properties":{"markdown":"Listen to the full episode - [CoRecursive: When AI Codes, What’s Left for me?](https://corecursive.com/coding-agents/).\n","markdownStyle":"Note","markdownStyleParsed":1,"markdownCodeLanguage":"","id":"a8e7a98f-9ef3-446d-8655-303c7a3dfc56"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"markdown":"399ad8d3-9de2-4b15-b320-77b141da48da","markdownStyle":"f252b61f-a005-461f-aecf-b35b9d98168c","markdownStyleParsed":"ccdea34a-cf2c-4f24-bf6f-82ac70d58f55","markdownCodeLanguage":"2e13e438-4ffe-4fcb-ad5f-f082b225d6f6","id":"2ecacc17-3cf2-474a-bab2-cc5f0103853c"}}]}]}],"fieldIdentifiers":{"layout":"4c413336-c23d-4575-b965-56fb068790ec","layoutParsed":"c72888f3-45bd-461e-ac16-3f933dea64a5","paddingTop":"370efc68-d8e4-4aa2-bdb3-cbbfd5cd75b6","paddingTopParsed":"77f4429e-4611-456d-947f-4188dc7f431d","paddingBottom":"abbbaf8e-bc84-4d21-977d-334e2bfa18de","paddingBottomParsed":"aaf6eebe-9000-4e44-9df6-6c3f99579bd7","backgroundColor":"05183abd-07fd-4ccc-a9a8-6a126f9c79a6","backgroundColorParsed":"b75ef5a0-fbef-428f-8b0e-4e0fe3555668"}},{"identifier":"0321ec95-967b-4499-92e0-370de3ebcc86","type":"CommunityPortal.SingleColumnSection","properties":{"layout":"Standard","layoutParsed":0,"paddingTop":"Large","paddingTopParsed":0,"paddingBottom":"Large","paddingBottomParsed":0,"backgroundColor":"White","backgroundColorParsed":1},"zones":[{"identifier":"1ec806e0-8982-4142-bd30-064e176321aa","widgets":[{"identifier":"f1321bc6-6562-4d33-bcef-aa3ea8609707","type":"CommunityPortal.HeadingWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"94526e6c-6cfa-4097-afee-02c5d24da28c","properties":{"headingText":"So, where do we go from here?","headingLevel":"H2","headingLevelsParsed":1,"headingAlignment":"Left","headingAlignmentsParsed":0,"showHeadingAnchor":true,"id":"0e7d56fa-4040-4921-a374-897e746b2c49"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"headingText":"11ffe2fa-0d40-42fc-ba8d-3d7e12da1ef3","headingLevel":"b579fe79-5943-4a4a-b4cb-783ae73f9db7","headingLevelsParsed":"c3fe1bb7-387a-4499-af66-edc4d85c8e24","headingAlignment":"c52b737b-de35-4af3-9b24-7d6269924554","headingAlignmentsParsed":"57af8d46-be0f-4e79-a9b2-c3b6aa4cd0b4","showHeadingAnchor":"203bab3c-9aef-4e22-ad90-a09cd4af9230","id":"195bfe9f-d60e-4b50-adc9-da403644d545"}}]},{"identifier":"0ca37869-418d-4a66-9a42-8aed6064bc19","type":"CommunityPortal.MarkdownWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"936e5cdc-8f80-47ed-9a54-3b85542422bc","properties":{"markdown":"If you're a software developer, building Xperience by Kentico projects with .NET, C#, React, and the classic web platform technologies, the AI technology wave is impacting you.
