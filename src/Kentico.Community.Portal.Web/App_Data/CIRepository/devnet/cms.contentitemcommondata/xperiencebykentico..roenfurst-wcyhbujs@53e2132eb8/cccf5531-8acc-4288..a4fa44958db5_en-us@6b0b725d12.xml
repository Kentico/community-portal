Jeroen shares his thoughts.\n\n> It's important that software gets its updates regularly \\[...] because software nowadays gets attacked a lot, there are security vulnerabilities inside software, and you need to address them.\n>\n> Luckily the software nowadays is easier to update coming from very early versions of Kentico \\[...] but nowadays it's very common that these updates are smaller in scale, meaning that monthly or every 2 months we can apply patches or even Refreshes \\[...] with an additional benefit of getting new features.\n\nJeroen also mentions that the peace of mind this security focus brings gives confidence to the IT teams his clients have, but marketers see less value here. They are more interested in the new features and capabilities [being delivered monthly in Xperience by Kentico](https://roadmap.kentico.com/tabs/6-next-refreshes).\n\nThis makes a lot of sense! The value can vary from person to person. It's important to identify and communicate it to each stakeholder.\n\n","markdownStyle":"Standard","markdownStyleParsed":0,"markdownCodeLanguage":"","id":"1fdad08c-e281-48f1-96d1-2126dc971d5f"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"markdown":"ba8e45c2-2f75-4f73-b76e-8bbde788ad46","markdownStyle":"70434ce1-b8e4-4c0a-a711-c4c1505d5255","markdownStyleParsed":"1eeb885f-2fbd-43d8-bb87-3ec5f4203d46","markdownCodeLanguage":"10bcdc4a-3a31-4602-a66e-4d37a37e21a6","id":"100a81a6-098c-46f9-b3ba-a9a111bba036"}}]},{"identifier":"42ca7927-d366-4529-bea7-4271800f9e89","type":"CommunityPortal.HeadingWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"3e685a58-ebb3-4f42-a018-181cbd4f5e8d","properties":{"headingText":"Renovate keeps you up to date","headingLevel":"H2","headingLevelsParsed":1,"headingAlignment":"Left","headingAlignmentsParsed":0,"showHeadingAnchor":true,"id":"9ecb70a1-0c81-4347-afeb-215c76fd66e7"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"headingText":"ffe67c05-67c9-4705-98c2-a9e887ef670d","headingLevel":"38347700-74ee-4fd1-b94d-9f46241c7559","headingLevelsParsed":"e7129791-ee25-4124-9791-effa85326f83","headingAlignment":"cb14bf30-62c5-4f2e-9918-cc3bac38681d","headingAlignmentsParsed":"29755fe8-854b-45f9-9150-1021cf8a3a7d","showHeadingAnchor":"436394b7-a8c6-4294-997b-b6c74906dabf","id":"b3cb8b9f-7464-4d5f-a175-8b8ae62458e7"}}]},{"identifier":"bcf79b48-cece-43bd-bea9-3a34571bc9f4","type":"CommunityPortal.MarkdownWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"01f047bd-3b59-493c-850e-727f8462fda2","properties":{"markdown":"Jeroen explains his team uses [Renovate](https://github.com/renovatebot/renovate), brining automation to dependency management.\n\n> Renovate is an automated dependency update tool. It helps to update dependencies in your code without needing to do it manually. When Renovate runs on your repo, it looks for references to dependencies (both public and private) and, if there are newer versions available, Renovate can create pull requests to update your versions automatically.\n\nFellow Kentico MVP, Liam Goldfinch, wrote about using a similar technology called [Dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot) to [keep an Xperience by Kentico project up to date](https://www.goldfinch.me/blog/keeping-your-xperience-by-kentico-project-up-to-date-using-dependabot).\n\nJeroen mentions his team is investing in Renovate because it makes the work of updating dependencies *easier*.\n\n> The time to go to the next version is getting easier with less risks because the software automation part, testing, ect... has quite matured over the last couple of years and therefore we can apply these updates when they become available to keep our software up to date.\n\nSmaller more frequent updates, applied through automation are easier for a team to manage. This means it's easier to communicate the value to clients since the cost in developer hours is lower.\n\nHigher value and lower cost means better [ROI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return_on_investment), which is something that marketing teams are definitely interested in with their DXP solution investments.\n","markdownStyle":"Standard","markdownStyleParsed":0,"markdownCodeLanguage":"","id":"d5354b6d-4b09-4be1-9e5c-37848153f11b"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"markdown":"c2ba1009-3fce-4800-9b37-8afaf690b5df","markdownStyle":"b92eed37-52a8-46ea-835c-aac09fde0b4a","markdownStyleParsed":"4f2a8bbd-d8e4-4683-852d-8b0621d255d8","markdownCodeLanguage":"a4d79bb7-3145-4c93-9a76-18267155b365","id":"7cdfc504-7f26-4ff5-911e-6544209faaed"}}]},{"identifier":"c4076500-b492-49ef-bf53-b8c2821b42ef","type":"CommunityPortal.HeadingWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"5590d2c7-0304-464a-9a73-3111c37aa283","properties":{"headingText":"What happens if you get behind?","headingLevel":"H2","headingLevelsParsed":1,"headingAlignment":"Left","headingAlignmentsParsed":0,"showHeadingAnchor":true,"id":"2ded0e5d-1041-47e6-966d-f38c6e398725"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"headingText":"d443b894-9df2-4572-8a5a-0a01ade08195","headingLevel":"ba00b410-7d00-411a-b34a-dbb1ee1823ad","headingLevelsParsed":"cc86e24c-9f7f-422d-99c3-2a4e1199d9f2","headingAlignment":"526870c0-d7e2-4227-9e85-7269fb5d80b1","headingAlignmentsParsed":"0547d309-66b0-44e7-ae44-33718ef50afc","showHeadingAnchor":"d33f758a-3f44-4d59-98d7-b336ea58823d","id":"6f962941-a440-42ca-bbbb-76c99ac90721"}}]},{"identifier":"7ac58a94-dca8-44d8-94ad-ed8409b6b6bd","type":"CommunityPortal.MarkdownWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"fefa40f7-fd6b-4377-b78b-c3a48066886f","properties":{"markdown":"Another important point to remember is the opportunity cost of not keeping a project's dependencies updated now. If you wait, and keep putting off the updates to save time and money you could end up with a much higher total cost later.\n\nHas technology moved on in the meantime? Is there budget available to do a large number of updates all at once? Taking this approach almost never involves automation, which means increased cost.\n\nJeroen says this can put a team in a position where they have a choice to make - go through the process of applying all the updates or start a **rebuild**. No one likes hearing the dreaded **R** word!\n\n> If the updates are on a more regular basis and smaller, piece by piece, then it's much easier to keep on track and be aligned with the latest that is coming out.\n\nThis statement from Jeroen peels back the layer of the dependency management onion a bit. It's not *only* important that dependencies are updated regularly. It's *also* important that it's both possible and easy to update your dependencies regularly.\n\nIf a library or framework you use only releases major version updates every 3 years, you'll have 3 years of changes to incorporate into your project. If instead the dependency releases an update every month, there's only so much that could have changed in that time - it's inherently easier to incorporate into your project and far less risky.\n\nThis is a great example of why Xperience by Kentico's [monthly Refreshes](https://docs.kentico.com/changelog) and evergreen product strategy are extremely important. You need your dependencies to support that strategy you want to take, otherwise you'll constantly be fighting against them.\n","markdownStyle":"Standard","markdownStyleParsed":0,"markdownCodeLanguage":"","id":"02b57c0a-0109-4197-be70-64eebe9770cb"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"markdown":"95eff99b-cda7-4bb2-8869-bdd9ddc1e9aa","markdownStyle":"ea8c3fa8-8972-4cc3-ac48-720d8a221482","markdownStyleParsed":"ecc1413d-d8bb-4d02-9cfd-2fec4edd91da","markdownCodeLanguage":"c79b02c9-7854-411a-9241-81736f813ce0","id":"d9e5bb5f-bd57-4177-a243-4ef0cd0d22e0"}}]},{"identifier":"0869cdd5-00e4-41a2-be90-917e0d571f32","type":"CommunityPortal.HeadingWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"f8da5282-1663-4bd9-a8f9-2e37495e98fd","properties":{"headingText":"A different business strategy","headingLevel":"H2","headingLevelsParsed":1,"headingAlignment":"Left","headingAlignmentsParsed":0,"showHeadingAnchor":true,"id":"dd7357b1-869e-4935-b96a-4675f1b3a1c1"},"fieldIdentifiers":{"headingText":"f49b495b-d233-4f3d-a81c-f5b3f052fc2b","headingLevel":"757c2799-ba53-4cd1-87bd-5b569a5d257b","headingLevelsParsed":"de1f5f4a-2cfc-484e-82d6-c66ab1120dd9","headingAlignment":"d46179ff-1453-44b1-8357-a2345dc217d0","headingAlignmentsParsed":"62944e9f-099e-4901-99db-5a0636c7abf4","showHeadingAnchor":"3efa71fe-9ab9-45ee-90fc-c90cc9cea2a7","id":"73ac1647-1ac7-44d1-8dc1-0defd7fc8417"}}]},{"identifier":"0fae5bac-99c9-4245-a7c5-83fa14fddf6f","type":"CommunityPortal.MarkdownWidget","variants":[{"identifier":"c1ae6b28-2ba3-491a-8ff5-1e05e06feb7e","properties":{"markdown":"Who would have thought that a software release cycle would have an impact on the way a digital agency, like TrueLime, interfaces with clients?\n\n> Looking at it from a company perspective, it forces us to change our way of work \\[...].

    <![CDATA[There's no guarantees in life except for death and taxes... and that your software library dependencies will probably be out of date next week. Software doesn't maintain itself - at least not yet - so developers need to spend time keeping things functional and up to date. In this Expert Chat, we talk with Jeroen Furst - a long time Kentico MVP and architect at TrueLime a Kentico Gold partner digital agency. Jeroen shares his perspective on how his team keeps their Kentico solutions up to date, why it's never been easier than with Xperience by Kentico's continuous and incremental release cycle, and how he explains the value of this work to his agency's clients.]]>
