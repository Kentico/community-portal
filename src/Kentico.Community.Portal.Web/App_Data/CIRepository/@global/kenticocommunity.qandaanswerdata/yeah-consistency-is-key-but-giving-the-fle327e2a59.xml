Yeah consistency is key, but giving the flexibility of which way to enforce is important.

Clients (and their SEO teams) often demand that URLs are output in HTML in a particular way - sometimes they demand with and sometimes without a trailing slash. So the current XbyK default works fine for the latter, but makes it difficult for the former.

We already have a middleware to handle the redirection to the correct version, and I think we've looked at doing something similar to what you've both mentioned in terms of creating an extension, but ideally there would be a configuration where XbyK would respect this as a configuration option.

Thanks for the suggestions - I'll also submit to the roadmap as an idea!
