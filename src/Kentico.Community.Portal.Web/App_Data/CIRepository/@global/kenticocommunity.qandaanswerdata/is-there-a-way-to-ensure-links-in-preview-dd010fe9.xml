Is there a way to ensure links in Preview mode (that were not handled automatically) get handled properly as a whole?

If I'm reading your response (and the docs you linked) right, it seems I would have to leverage `ApplyPreviewContext` for _every_ single link. I don't think that's feasible, especially because the overwhelming majority of these links reside inside an RTE on a given page. And there are LOTS of pages. The links got there primarily by being migrated in using the Migration Tool, not manually added by a user.

How can I ensure that when in Preview mode, all of them are treated such that the proper channel domain gets added? Unfortunately, at this point, processing them manually (one at a time) just isn't realistic.
