When I see issues that appear only for the deployed version of an application I investigate in a few areas

1. Infrastructure configuration
1. Release vs Debug builds
1. Race conditions

You can rule out #2 by doing a Release build locally and "deploying" the app on your machine with a `dotnet publish` - more specifically the prep steps you take to build your SaaS deployment package.

It's more difficult to test #1, especially since you don't manage the infrastructure for SaaS but I also don't think this is a likely cause.

For #3 you can look for code that uses `Task`/`Task<T>` but hasn't been `await`'d or it is `await`'d in a different order than it was executed. ASP.NET Core middleware and Controller/endpoint code is the most common place to find `Task` based race conditions.

The reason the race conditions show up when the application is deployed is because the execution speed, single request nature of `localhost` hides a lot of problems. Also middleware based race conditions can also be related to #2 in the list above since some middleware paths are only executed in Release mode.
