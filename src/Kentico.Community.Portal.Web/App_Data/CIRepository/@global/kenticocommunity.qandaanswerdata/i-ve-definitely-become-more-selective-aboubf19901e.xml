I’ve definitely become more selective about attending in-person events compared to a few years ago. Mainly for three reasons:

1. I moved from a city to a smaller town, so getting to meetups now involves more travel and time.
2. With kids and work, I’ve learned to value my time more carefully.
3. There’s so much great content online these days, from tech influencers to recorded sessions, that I often feel pretty well covered.

That said, I’d still make the effort for a meetup if it meant catching up with friends I don’t get to see often or if it focused on something I really care about. And yes, Kentico is high on that list!

The event you mentioned sounds great, but since it’s in the US, it’s not realistic for me. The thing is, the Kentico community is relatively small and scattered around the world. So I’ll be looking forward to the next Kentico Connections instead.
