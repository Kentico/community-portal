> Communicating this concept to content editors is one of my main responsibilities when consulting and training.

Great point! It's easy to forget that customers of CMS/DXP are often not well versed in the available stragies and best practices for using them. Someone has to educate customers about this and it's often senior developers who understand the impact of a good or bad content model and are in the best position to help communicate this.

> Rich Text editing can become cumbersome, especially when trying to create complex elements like accordions, FAQs, carousels, content tabs, or tables. Relying too heavily on these editors can lead to disorganized content and a poor editing experience.

I think this is a great way to explain the value of structured content - use examples marketers are familiar with like FAQs and carousels even if really complex content models "show off" the value better.

I also like that you mention a "_poor editing experience_" because it's easy to focus on the initial authoring experience and forget that it will be someone's responsibility to come back to that content, understand it, and make changes to it in the future.
