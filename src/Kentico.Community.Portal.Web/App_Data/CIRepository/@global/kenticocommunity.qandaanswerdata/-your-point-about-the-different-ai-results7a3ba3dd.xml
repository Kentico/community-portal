> Your point about the different AI results each time being a feature not an issue resonates with me a lot. I haven't looked at it that way before - great food for thought for me.

I heard on a podcast someone say, "if you need determinism have AI help you write a program or some code". It was a good reminder that AI's are capable of producing deterministic solutions even if their output is non-deterministic 🧠.

> Also, the "I shouldn't have to use it (the "explanation" muscle) anyway because AI *should just work better*." feeling - this so relatable hahaha.

I think good programmers become good by learning how and when to ask for more context so they build the right thing. I've found that AI often does what you ask and doesn't ask for context. It takes the context given. Sometimes this is enough, but sometimes not 🙃.
