@Mike, first a few questions before diagnosing your problems.

1. _Why_ do you need to separate your presentation code into 1 or more libraries?

    A multi-project architecture will add complexity to your solution and you should adopt it only if it helps manage complexity in other areas.

1. If you _do_ need a multi-project architecture, what do you want to isolate and what do you want to share?

    You will need to decide with each presentational component and generated class, which project it should assigned to and how to organize your dependencies.

If you _need_ a multi-project solution architecture to isolate your website channel presentation logic, then you'd likely end up with something like this:

![Multi-project Xperience by Kentico architecture](/getmedia/d9af6f07-a325-4d12-9efe-b7a4f08ebbc9/xperience-multi-project-architecture.webp)

Your website channel libraries will contain Controller, View, View model, View component, and content type classes that are used by specific website channels.

Your core library will contain the types of code that are used across all website channels.

When using those separate library projects in your ASP.NET Core project, you'll need to make sure you [add the application parts](https://andrewlock.net/when-asp-net-core-cant-find-your-controller-debugging-application-parts/) to make them discoverable by ASP.NET Core, and [enable class discovery](https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/customization/integrate-custom-code#enable-class-discovery) for any Xperience code in each project.
