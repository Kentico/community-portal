> We took a marketing team and trained them on Markdown [...] they were able to adopt it without much issue. Links and images are always difficult without a great Markdown editor, which we split into separate elements for the editor experience.

It's good to hear your non-coder users were able to adopt Markdown without much issue. I agree it's a good middleground between pure structured content and rich text... and the image/link syntax could _still_ be easier in Markdown.

I think a solid Markdown editor like [Milkdown](https://milkdown.dev/playground) can make things easier for editors, but still requires some technical implementation time.

> I like how the Community.Kentico.com has their markdown editor with the similar hey, don't know markdown, click here! type of link.

Thanks! I thought that would be helpful to people 😅.
