We don't have features like individual form components listed on our [product roadmap](https://roadmap.kentico.com/tabs/6-next-refreshes), but that doesn't mean you won't see them released in a Refresh.

We have had multiple requests for a calendar/date Form Component, so if you would also like to see this feature added, click the "Submit idea" button on the roadmap website and let us know your needs and use-cases. All the feedback we get there is cataloged and impacts prioritization of work.

We do have a future goal of using the same set of "builder" technology for all builders in the product - page, form, email, ect... this is listed on the roadmap under [strategic pillars](https://roadmap.kentico.com/c/118-universal-visual-builders).

I'm not sure when we'll see major updates to the Form Builder (custom visibility and validation conditions), but you can also request the features you specifically need through the same "Submit idea" button on the roadmap site.
