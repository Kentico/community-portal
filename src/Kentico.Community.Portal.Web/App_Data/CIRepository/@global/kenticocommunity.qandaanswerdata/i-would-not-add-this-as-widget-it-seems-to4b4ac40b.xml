I would not add this as widget.

It seems to be very specific and maybe it's better located in a custom template of a special page type.

I would also move the data out of widgets, because it is not the place for that content. I would think about using the content hub and maybe taxonomie for relations if reference fields will not work.

You can also use data nodes in the content tree.\
Depends.\
Do you have a clean structure of that content, that is not specific for website content => content hub\
Do you only have this structure in the website and it is depending on language version and website channel => page content tree

Use the template to render it to the page instead of widgets.

I would not do it with widgets because no one will understand how to set up this things in that complexity.\
And it has to be set up in every page that has such a thing.\
And in every language version again.

In a template you can use template properties to reference the content or a reference field in the page type.

Also would recommend the guide as Trevor still did.
