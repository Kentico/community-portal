Xperience by Kentico uses [recipient lists](https://docs.kentico.com/x/yQL9Cg) to manage subscribers to email marketing and doesn't allow for duplicate email addresses in lists. Subscribers can't "accidentally" re-subscribe to the same list.

If you have multiple lists and you want to send the same email to all of them you have a few options.

1. Create your email, send it to the first list and then clone it and then change the recipient list you are sending the cloned email to in its properties. Repeat until you've send the email to all lists.
2. Create a single list for all subscribers and then use contact group segmentation to control who receives each email you send ([this is planned for the August 2025 Refresh](https://roadmap.kentico.com/c/321-enhanced-recipient-targeting-for-emails)).
3. Programmatically add subscribers to a "combined" list and send the email to this list. While there isn't a UI in the Xperience administration to manually opt recipients into a list, [the APIs are available for developers](https://api-reference.kentico.com/api/CMS.EmailMarketing.EmailMarketingRecipientInfo.html) and you can extend the admin UI with a custom UI that would allow you to perform this operation for existing lists or specific contacts.

Our [planned unified contact profile feature](https://roadmap.kentico.com/c/230-unified-contact-profile) will pave the way for future improvements in managing customer data and related marketing features like recipient lists.
