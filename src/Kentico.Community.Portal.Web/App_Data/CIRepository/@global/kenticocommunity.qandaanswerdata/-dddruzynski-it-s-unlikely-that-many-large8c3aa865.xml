It's unlikely that many _large_ investments will be made to [the Media Library](https://docs.kentico.com/x/agKiCQ) in Xperience by Kentico (v28.4.1 at the time of this comment).

The long term goal for media asset management is to focus 100% on the Content hub, which means we will eventually deprecate the Media Library and recommend using [content modeling](https://docs.kentico.com/x/Do3WCQ) (custom content types, [content item assets](https://docs.kentico.com/business-users/content-hub#upload-files), and the Content hub).

All of our current UX improvements for content management are related to the Content hub** and in the future you'll see specific UX improvements for media management.

For now, if you have a small number of media assets, modeling them with content types and using the Content hub might be the best approach. If you have a large number of media assets then using the Media Library will serve you better.

If you have items which you would like to protect behind a login, use the Content hub.

If you have items you'd like to broadly share links to, I'd also recommend the Content hub, combined with a URL shortener service. Or, maybe link to a landing page for that media asset, which helps give context (description/publication date) for the asset and makes the visitor engagement more sticky.

I think the balance will tip, unanimously in the favor of content modeled media later this year, but we won't deprecate the Media Library until the Content hub is clearly a great replacement.
