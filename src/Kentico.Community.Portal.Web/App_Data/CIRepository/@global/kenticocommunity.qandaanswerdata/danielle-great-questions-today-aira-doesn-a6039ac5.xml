Danielle,

Great questions!

Today AIRA doesn't actually have any context about an Xperience by Kentico project beyond the text and images provided to it for [content transformation and generation](https://docs.kentico.com/x/aira_xp).

Additionally, _**we don't have integration points for teams to add their own context to AIRA**_, but we have explored the engineering and architecture requirements to make something like this possible.

The first feature to automatically provide AIRA with application context will be [Customer journey insights powered by AIRA](https://roadmap.kentico.com/c/251-customer-journey-insights-powered-by-aira), which is planned for an upcoming Refresh. [AIRA's conversational interface and in-product guidance](/blog/xperience-by-kentico-refresh-june-12-2025#aira-in-product-guidance) was actually built to support this evolution in AIRA's capabilities.

I expect we will open up AIRA to teams for their own customization in the future, but we don't have a specific date at the moment. We definitely recommend sharing your use cases [on Xperience's roadmap](https://roadmap.kentico.com/tabs/6-next-refreshes) and based on my experiences working for a partner agency I think many others will be interested in the same kinds of enhancements you are asking about.
