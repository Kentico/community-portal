Our guide for upgrading to Xperience by Kentico mentions the Content hub as [a great alternative to custom tables](https://docs.kentico.com/guides/architecture/migrate-from-kx13/plan-your-strategy-for-migrating-features#structured-content-page-types) from previous Kentico products, but Xperience also supports [custom applications](https://docs.kentico.com/x/2gSiCQ) and [object types](https://docs.kentico.com/x/AKDWCQ) to model and manage **non-content data**.

That's the key for me - *is the data content or is it not content*?

Content is typically and needs the following attributes.

* Localized
* Uses publishing workflows and previewing of unpublished changes
* Benefits from visual usage tracking
* Audited with version management
* Prepped and deployed by marketers with content synchronization
* Granular view/edit permission access (workspaces, web page tree permissions)

Non-content data on the other hand has the following attributes.

* Single language
* No preview/publishing workflow requirements
* Might require an audit trail (depending on business requirements)
* Managed and deployed by developers and administrators
* Individual data items referenced directly in code
* View and edit permissions are all or nothing

So, does your custom table data fall into the category of content or not?

I would focus ***much less*** on the additional work to build the custom application and object type - this doesn't take much more time than creating a well designed content type with all the proper explanation text and validation to help marketers. You are building this project [for today and for the future](https://community.kentico.com/blog/xperience-by-kentico-saas-best-practices#no-more-rebuilds) so choose the path that has the long term payoff.&#x20;
