I'm glad you like it!

Here's some improvements I've thought about...

### Expirations

This would let us create badges based on recency or fun badges that are only visible for a short time. Here's some examples:

- Active in the past 90 days
- Exam certifications
- Friend of the community (if you did something nice 🤗)

### Notifications

When assigned a new badge, you would receive an email to let you know so you can change your selected badges in your account.

### Special badges

You can only select 3 badges to display next to your avatar. This is to prevent any UX issues but also to let people make a decision about which badges are most important to them.

But, we could have a tier of special badges which wouldn't count against your 3 badge limit, letting you have 4 or 5 badges!

### Levels

Badges could be leveled up - bronze, silver, gold versions of the same badge but representing more of an accomplishment in that area.
