We're also in the process of moving some things from a media library to the content hub. One slight issue we've run into is replicating the direct file path feature that K13 media libraries had. As far as I can tell there's no "easy" way to look up a content item by its folder. I put easy in quotes there because we did figure out a way, but it involves splitting apart the tree, getting code names for each segment, getting the ID, and then looking for a content item whose folder ID (which is _not_ exposed via `IContentQueryDataContainer`) and name matches. None of that was obvious without breaking out a disassembler and seeing how XByK does this now.

Is there a better way to do that? Or any plan to introduce code to help with that?
