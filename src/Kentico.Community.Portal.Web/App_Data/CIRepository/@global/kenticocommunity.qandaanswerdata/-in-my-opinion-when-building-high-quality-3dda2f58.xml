> In my opinion, when building high quality websites, you still need both approaches. When done right, reusablity and governance still allow for flexibility and creativity.

I think we're in complete agreement 😅...

I have been thinking about this topic because many developers and content marketers might not realize what they are missing by relying too much on rich text.

This could happen because of the content management products they are used to working with (WordPress, MailChimp) which have great rich text authoring, but treat structured content - or at least the separation of content and design - as an uncommon corner case.

It could also happen because people have brought their 2016 mindset to 2024 and "why should I change if rich text still works?"

My goal with this post was to get a conversation started and make sure people were at least aware there are choices to be made and the value of structured content should not be dismissed - it will become more and more value as time goes on!
