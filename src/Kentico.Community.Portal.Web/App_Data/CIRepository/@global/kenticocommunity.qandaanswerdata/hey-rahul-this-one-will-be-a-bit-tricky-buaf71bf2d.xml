Hey Rahul,

This one will be a bit tricky, but i understand the need.  Firstly, just be aware of the one downside that if you link to a Web Page and save it just as the URL, it will not be able to dynamically adjust for language (although coming up there will be the [System redirects for delete and unpublish - Xperience by Kentico - Roadmap | Product Roadmap](https://roadmap.kentico.com/c/239-system-redirects-for-delete-and-unpublish), which should handle that).



Ultimately, you'll want to build out your own Form Component and register it for string types.  [Form components | Xperience by Kentico Documentation](https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder/form-components)

You'll want to inherit FormComponent\<YourProperties, string> so it will show up.

Then you'll want to use Kentico's React components and such to try to build it out, i would probably have a text box with a button "Link from Page" that launches the normal Kentico WebpageSelector (@kentico/xperience-admin-websites/WebPageSelector)

Here's the full list of Kentico Admin UI Components:\
[Reference - Admin UI form components | Xperience by Kentico Documentation](https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface/ui-form-components/reference-admin-ui-form-components)



Lastly, Kentico's installer provides an Admin UI Boilerplate that you'll want to use as your starting point:



<https://docs.kentico.com/developers-and-admins/installation#available-project-templates>

\
I think you just run `dotnet new kentico-xperience-admin-sample` and it will create that for you once you have the normal install (which i assume you already do).

Are you on the Kentico Community Slack?  If not, email me at tfayas through my gmail.com and i'll get you on, then you can message me and i'll help you out.
