Thanks Sean so much for your quick response! I’ve spent hours trying to apply your general suggestions to my case and investigating further. Unfortunately, I haven’t had much luck so far. Here are some specific thoughts based on your suggestions:

1. You’re right—it’s impossible to simulate Kentico’s SaaS environment locally, so I don’t think that approach will work.

2. At some point, I was able to “deploy” and run the site in a local folder using Visual Studio on my Windows machine. However, I couldn’t reproduce the issues in this setup. Even if I could, I’m not sure how I would identify the source of the error since it runs compiled code.

3. I manually reviewed the entire codebase for potential issues, and I also used the Parallel Checker extension for VS (https://github.com/blaeser/parallelchecker), but nothing came up.

Regarding the specific issue of the `StatusCode cannot be set because the response has already started.`, I tried removing most elements from the `_Layout.cshtml` file to limit any problematic code and redeployed to the SaaS environment, but still no luck, the issue is still there. I also removed custom middlewares and checked whether order of XbyK-related middlewares is correct. No luck.
I did notice that I’m able to reproduce the issue in the *Admin > Channels > Website Channel* when quickly navigating between *Preview* and *Page Builder*. 
The issue started appearing in the logs on August 26th. Around that time, I only made some CSS updates and cleared a few unused references to external NuGet packages. Is there any chance that this might XbyK-related issue? I am a bit desperate here.
