> **Execution Logs:**\
> Is there a way to extract or export detailed logs of what is executed when this command runs?

Not at this time. The only logs available are the ones that go to the console when the command is run. If a `--verbose` flag or some other kind of additional logging would be helpful for your deployment scenarios, [give us feedback on the product roadmap](https://roadmap.kentico.com/tabs/5-released).

> **Update Type Parameter:**\
> It would be helpful to have a parameter that allows specifying the type of update to run

Application updates need to be internally consistent for the application to run predictably. With the way the product is designed today it doesn't make sense to enable only partial data transformations during a hotfix or Refresh. The code expects the data to be in a specific state after an update completes and before the application runs.

> **SQL Script Generation:**\
> We’d also appreciate a parameter that enables generating the SQL script for the database updates without executing them. 

Updates aren't guaranteed to be SQL scripts. They can also include code-driven data transformations. There's no way to export a data migration authored in C# as a SQL migration. So, even if we could export all the SQL code run during an update you'd still potentially be missing some of the behavior.

Additionally, we consider the database structure to be an implementation detail. The .NET APIs are the publish API surface that are tied to our semver versioned releases, not the database.

We know customers and partners work directly with the database when performing more advanced custom queries or when [running SQL migration scripts](https://docs.kentico.com/x/ywAcCQ) in CI/CD scenarios. But, we do not want to expose these details so much that someone would rely on them.

> Otherwise, we believe these additions could be very beneficial for a wide range of scenarios, let us know if we need to submit these features somewhere else, so we can see a clear status of our feedback.

If you could describe these kinds of scenarios (how these enhancements would benefit your team or stakeholders) when you provide [feedback on our product roadmap](https://roadmap.kentico.com/tabs/5-released), that would be very helpful!
