<![CDATA[
The default system role that grants unrestricted access to all applications and features of the system regardless of permissions or other settings.
This role can not be deleted or edited in any way (as it is relied on by internal system logic), and it must always have at minimum one assigned user. Only existing administrators can assign this role to other users.
